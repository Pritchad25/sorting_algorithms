This repository contains solutions to the programming tasks of the C Sorting Algorithms and Big O notation
project done at the ALX Holberton Software Engineering School.Doing this project, I learnt the different sorting algorithms and when and how each of them can be applied to solve our programming challenges and real world problems.
